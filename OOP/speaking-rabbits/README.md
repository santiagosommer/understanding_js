# Speaking rabbits
This project demonstrates how **JavaScript classes** provide a cleaner syntax for creating objects that share behavior through **prototypes**.

## How to run locally
```bash
node classes.js
node prototypes.js
```

## Explanation
Prototypes are useful because they can make a common structure that is shared across multiple instances of objects.

Instead of duplicating functions for every instance, they reference a common prototype,
making object creation more memory-efficient and faster to execute.

Classes provide a clean syntax to implement them.
