# This

## How to run locally
```bash
node app.js
```

## Explanation
The `this` keyword refers to an internal value established in the current execution context ([[ThisBinding]]), which is determined by how the function is invoked. In many cases, it references the object through which the function was called, but it can also be undefined, a primitive, or inherited from the enclosing lexical scope (as in arrow functions).
